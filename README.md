## Authentication

Uses JWT tokens stored in localStorage. Automatically includes token in API requests.

## Styling

Tailwind CSS for styling with custom utility classes.

## State Management

Zustand for simple, efficient state management (authentication state).

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Deploy the `dist/` folder to your hosting service.

## Deploy to Vercel

This frontend is ready for Vercel. The included `vercel.json` makes React Router work on refresh and direct links.

### Vercel settings

- Framework preset: `Vite`
- Root directory: `cv-screening-frontend`
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`

### Required environment variable

Set this in Vercel before deploying:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain/api
```

Example:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://cv-screening-backend.onrender.com/api
```

## Backend hosting

The Django backend should be deployed separately on a Python host such as Render. This repo already includes [`render.yaml`](C:/Users/hp/Desktop/data/render.yaml) for that side.
